# Introduction

> Production API Endpoint:

```shell
https://[COMPANY].api.getslideapp.com/2
```

> Development API Endpoint:

```shell
https://dev.[COMPANY].api.getslideapp.com/2
```

> Make sure to replace `[COMPANY]` with your Company Id.

The Slide API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.

Requests made with test mode credentials never hit the banking networks and incur no cost.

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>[COMPANY]</code> in all API Requests with your Company Id.
</aside>


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
curl "https://[COMPANY].api.getslideapp.com/2" \
  -H "Authorization: [TOKEN]"
```

> Make sure to replace `[TOKEN]` with your API token.

Slide uses a token-based HTTP Authentication scheme.

Authenticate your account by including your token in API requests. Your API tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure!

Once a user has logged in and received a token, each subsequent request should include the token in the HTTP Authorization header.

<!-- You can register a new Slide API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).You can manage your API keys in the Dashboard.  -->




All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

Slide expects the API token to be included in the HTTP Authorization header in all API requests to the server:

`Authorization: [TOKEN]`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>[TOKEN]</code> with your personal API token.
